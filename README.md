# Concurrency Bookclub
In ApiumHub we were reading *Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks* by Paul Butcher; and I wanted to exprore some ideas in the book in Haskell.
This repo is just that. A hodgepodge of code.

## Development (whyâ€½)
This code is bootstrapped with [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) so install it via their instructions and just `stack repl` to play around.
